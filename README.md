# Week-3
Segment and image with code : Your code should do the following - Create a binary mask where the puzzle pieces are foreground and the rest of the image is background. Store this mask in the variable BW. Segment the image by creating a labeled matrix with three groups, one for the background and one for each color. Store the result in the variable labels. labels should only contain the values 1, 2, and 3

One can use this code for reference to their project. Image Segmenter app from MATLAB can be useful if you have difficulty in choosing the right morphological operations for your image.
